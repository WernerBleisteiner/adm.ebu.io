# audioTrackFormat

## Description

The `audioTrackFormat` element corresponds to a single set of samples or data in a single track in a storage medium. It is used to describe what format the data is in, allowing a renderer to decode the signal correctly. It is referred from the [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md) element, which is used to identify the combination of tracks required to decode the track data successfully.

For PCM audio an [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md) will refer to a single `audioTrackFormat` and so the two elements are effectively describing the same thing. For coded audio, multiple `audioTrackFormat`s will have to be combined in a single [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md) to generate decodable data.

Software that parses the model can start from either `audioTrackFormat` or [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md). To allow for this flexibility `audioTrackFormat` can also refer back to the [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md). However, it is a strict requirement that if this reference is used, the `audioTrackFormat` must refer to the same [`audioStreamFormat`](audio_stream_format.md) that is referring back to it.


## Example

```xml
<audioTrackFormat audioTrackFormatID="AT_00010001_01"
                  audioTrackFormatName="PCM_FrontLeft"
                  formatDefinition="PCM" formatLabel="0001">
  <audioStreamFormatIDRef>AS_00010001</audioStreamFormatIDRef>
</audioTrackFormat>
```

## Attributes

| Attribute            | Description                 | Example  | Required |
